An AI that plays racing games using computer vision

Using the fundamentals of image processing and machine learning we will create an AI that will leart to play racing games.
Right now the application using a Convolutional Neuronal Network (CNN) with a modified Alexnet structure created with Keras and Tensorflow
backend. 
The datased used for training is created by our selves using 175,000 samples.
